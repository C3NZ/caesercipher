# caesercipher
really simple Caeser shift encryption/decryption implementation in python

## description
With my simple implementation you have the ability to encrypt and decrypt messages using a caeser shift. More information about
the caeser shift can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=13&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwibmqLfq4_XAhUHQBoKHTQBC3YQFghhMAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCaesar_cipher&usg=AOvVaw0A2AvQqpQjgXYg8P08AOrM)


# Notes
story.txt and words.txt must be included in order for the program to work

tests provided for proof of functionality

This was apart of a problem set from MIT's course which can be found [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/). I've licensed my modifications of their software under the GPLv3 which is compatible with their creative commons license. MIT provided helper functions and some of the documentation, while I wrote the actual hangman implementation and documentation for how specific pieces of my implementation works.
